The Service is owned or controlled by Albert Zhang ("the Developer"). These Terms & Conditions affect your legal rights and obligations. If you do not agree to be bound by all of these Terms & Conditions, DO NOT access or use the Service. There may be times when the Developer offers a special feature that has its own terms and conditions that apply in addition to these Terms & Conditions. In those cases, the terms specific to the special feature control to the extent there is a conflict with these Terms & Conditions. <div class="legalBold">ARBITRATION NOTICE: EXCEPT IF YOU OPT-OUT AND EXCEPT FOR CERTAIN TYPES OF DISPUTES, YOU AGREE THAT DISPUTES BETWEEN YOU AND THE DEVELOPER WILL BE RESOLVED BY BINDING, INDIVIDUAL ARBITRATION AND YOU WAIVE YOUR RIGHT TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION LAWSUIT OR CLASS-WIDE ARBITRATION. </div></div><div class="legalHeading">Basic Terms</div><ol type="1" class="legalese"> <li>You are responsible for any activity that occurs through your interactions with the Service.</li><li>You agree that you will not solicit, collect or use the login credentials of other users of the Service.</li><li>You are responsible for keeping any private information you input into the Service secret and secure.</li><li>You may not use the Service for any illegal or unauthorized purpose.
